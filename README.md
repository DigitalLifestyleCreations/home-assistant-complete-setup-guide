# Home Assistant Complete Setup Guide
The always up-to-date, start-to-finish, comprehensive guide to setting up a robust, sophisticated, Home Assistant-based home automation system.

This project aims to be a regularly updated, step-by-step guide to installing Home Assistant and all associated technologies such as MQTT, Node-RED, Lovelace, Tasmota, and more. The target audience is anyone who wants an awesome smarthome - regardless of technical expertise.

[The Wiki](https://github.com/DigitalLifestyleCreations/home-assistant-complete-setup-guide/wiki) for this project is its primary destination, so [start there](https://github.com/DigitalLifestyleCreations/home-assistant-complete-setup-guide/wiki). If, while following along in the guide in the Wiki, you encounter a step which appears to be outdated or inaccurate (a menu option is missing, a command does not complete as described and/or returns an error message) please [open an issue](https://github.com/DigitalLifestyleCreations/home-assistant-complete-setup-guide/issues/new) so that the issue can be reviewed and addressed/resolved.

Because this guide's intended audience is people of all ages and technical levels, a glossary of technical terms has been creates (and will be expanded over time) to provide definitions for all technical terms used. If you see a technical term that you do not understand and it is not clearly defined in the [Tech Terms Glossary](https://github.com/DigitalLifestyleCreations/home-assistant-complete-setup-guide/wiki/Tech-Terms-Glossary), please [open an issue](https://github.com/DigitalLifestyleCreations/home-assistant-complete-setup-guide/issues/new) so that it can be addressed/resolved.

If there is home automation functionality that is not addressed by this guide that you would like to see added, please [open a feature request issue](https://github.com/DigitalLifestyleCreations/home-assistant-complete-setup-guide/issues/new).
